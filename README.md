# coco_explorer

Common Objects in Context (COCO) is an image and captions dataset used for training and
evaluating machine learning models. The COCO dataset includes labeled images across 80 label
types (called categories), including people, animals, vehicles, and other real-world objects. The
COCO Explorer is a web interface (https://cocodataset.org/#explore) that allows a user to
search the dataset by category and view the results. The Explorer is a great tool to get familiar
with different categories in the dataset in order to better train machine learning models and
reason about their results on certain inputs.
